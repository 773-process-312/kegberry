# Say Hello to Kegberry

You've got a Raspberry Pi and you love beer on tap.  Now what? *Make it a
Kegberry*.

## What can it do?

* **Keg Volume Monitor.** Want to know what's left?  With a little extra
  hardware, your Kegberry becomes a powerful and battle-tested keg monitor.
* **Digital Tap List.**  Give your taps an internet presence.  Kegberry's
  server lets everyone know what's on tap.
* **Twitter, Untappd, and more.** Links to [Untappd](https://untappd.com/)
  for beverage information; posts to your site's Twitter account when you
  add and remove kegs.
* **Notification System.** Want to be alerted when the keg is running low,
  or when someone has started pouring?  No problem; Kegberry does it all.
* **Account System.** Give your friends and family access to your data, and
  enable privacy modes to keep others out.
