**Current Version:** 2.0.0b3<br/>
**Last Updated:** 8/26/2014


## What can it do?

* **Manage Your Kegs Online.** An online admin interface makes it simple
  to add and change kegs, configure system settings, and download backup
  data.
* **Comes In All Sizes.** Whether you have a massive system with
  dozens of taps, or a simple single-tap kegerator, Kegberry is flexible.
  There's no fixed limit on the number of taps and kegs; it's a database.
* **Keg Volume Monitor.** Want to know what's left?  With a little extra
  hardware, your Kegberry becomes a powerful and battle-tested keg monitor.
* **Digital Tap List.**  Give your taps an internet presence.  Kegberry's
  server lets everyone know what's on tap, and you can show it off 
  on a TV or HDMI display in spiffy fullscreen mode.
* **Twitter, Untappd, and more.** Links to [Untappd](https://untappd.com/)
  for beverage information; posts to your site's Twitter account when you
  add and remove kegs.
* **Notification System.** Receive an e-mail alert when the keg is changed,
  or when a keg is running low (if you have enabled flow monitoring).
* **Account System.** Give your friends and family access to your data, and
  enable privacy modes to keep others out.
* **Powerful API.** Developers can build new applications that communicate
  with the system using the [Kegbot API](https://kegbot.org/docs/api).
