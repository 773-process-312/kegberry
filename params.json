{"name":"Kegberry","tagline":"Keg Monitoring and Digital Taplist for Raspberry Pi","body":"# Kegberry: Monitor Your Beer Kegs\r\n\r\nKegberry turns your Raspberry Pi into an complete beer tap monitoring\r\nsystem!\r\n\r\n**Main Repository:** https://github.com/Kegbot/kegberry\r\n\r\n## Quickstart\r\n\r\nImpatient? Try this!\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Kegbot/kegberry/master/src/install.sh)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nRead on for more detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nKegberry is based on and includes several opensource projects:\r\n\r\n* [Kegbot Server](https://github.com/Kegbot/kegbot-server): Web user interface,\r\n  database backend, API.\r\n* [Kegbot Pycore](https://github.com/Kegbot/kegbot-pycore): Flow monitoring\r\n  and sensing loop.\r\n* [Kegboard](https://github.com/Kegbot/kegboard): Arduino-based firmware and\r\n  schematics for flow sensing, temperature sensing (DS18B20), and\r\n  RFID or OneWire-based authentication tokens.\r\n\r\nFor more information about Kegbot, see the\r\n[Kegbot home page](https://kegbot.org).\r\n\r\n## Install Guide\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nIf you have a freshly installed Raspbian device, you're probably\r\ngood to go.\r\n\r\n* **Kegbot Hardware**: You'll need the Kegbot hardware -- a flow meter and a\r\n  controller board -- in order to collect and report data.  Support for using\r\n  the Pi's GPIOs instead of a kegboard is [coming soon](https://github.com/Kegbot/kegberry/issues/6).\r\n  See [Get Kegbot](https://kegbot.org/get-kegbot) for an overview of the hardware.\r\n* **Dedicated Raspberry Pi**: The installer script assumes you'll be dedicating\r\n  the target RPi to Kegberry; for example, it replaces the default nginx\r\n  configuration with Kegbot's.\r\n* **Raspbian**: These instructions assume you've installed a fresh copy of\r\n  [Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org/) on your RPi.  These instructions have\r\n  been tested with version **2014-01-07**\r\n  ([installation instructions](http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup)).\r\n* **pi user**: Configuration files assume we'll be running Kegbot as\r\n  the `pi` user. If you'd prefer to use a different account, you'll need\r\n  to make these adjustments after installing Kegberry.\r\n\r\nIf your setup doesn't quite match these requirements, don't worry; at\r\nthe moment, Kegberry is just a shortcut.  Consult the\r\n[full installation guide](https://kegbot.org/docs/server/) instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Install Kegberry\r\n\r\nConnect to your pi and run the following script:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Kegbot/kegberry/master/src/install.sh)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSit back and relax as [kegbot-server](https://github.com/Kegbot/kegbot-server),\r\nMySQL, and all related dependencies are installed and configured for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Configure Kegbot Server\r\n\r\nOnce Kegberry has finished installing your system, you're ready to sign in\r\nand configure your shiny new Kegbot Server.\r\n\r\nNavigate to your RPi's IP address in your browser and you should see the\r\nsetup wizard.\r\n\r\nOnce you complete setup, reboot.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nTo report a problem, please use the\r\n[Kegberry issue tracker](https://github.com/Kegbot/kegberry/issues).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Upgrading\r\n\r\n### Upgrading Kegbot Server\r\n\r\nUpgrading `kegbot-server` on a Kegberry device follows the same steps as on\r\nany other Linux server.  See the\r\n[official upgrade docs](https://kegbot.org/docs/server/upgrade-kegbot/) for more\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n### Upgrading the entire Kegberry image\r\n\r\nKegberry does not (yet) include a full-system updater.  To upgrade a device, we\r\nadvise you to backup all data, install a new system image, and re-run the\r\nkegberry installer from scratch.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\n\r\nThe RPi is an amazing device, but Kegbot Server was written to target machines\r\nwith much greater computing resources.  You may find the server to be\r\nsubstantially slower than on a \"real\" machine.\r\n\r\nKegberry currently does not provide any extra tools for backing up or restoring\r\nyour server data.  You should make regular backups of your MySQL database and\r\nuploaded media (`~pi/kegbot-data/media`).\r\n\r\nSince Kegbot runs as the `pi` user, and since the `pi` user has `sudo` access\r\nin Raspbian, a vulnerability in the Kegbot server could lead to a compromise\r\nof the entire device.  You should run Kegbot as another user or remove\r\n`sudo` access if this is a concern for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License and Copyright\r\n\r\nAll code is offered under the GPLv2 license, unless otherwise noted.
