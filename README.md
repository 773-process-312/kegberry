Kegberry: Kegbot for Raspberry Pi
=================================

Overview
--------

Kegberry is a Kegbot server for your Raspberry Pi.  Since [Kegbot Server](https://github.com/Kegbot/kegbot)
is a Python/Django application, most of the work here is simply glue to automate
and simplify running it on Raspbian.
